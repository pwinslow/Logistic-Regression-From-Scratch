#The Goal:  

This mini-project will confront a basic classification problem with two methods. One will be to design my own logistic regression classifier from scratch while the other will be to use scikit-learn's built in logistic regression classifier. The goal is to compare the accuracies for the two methods in an effort to determine which is better. I will decide which is better based on which classifier achieves the highest accuracy score after taking care to avoid overfitting in both cases.
